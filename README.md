I personally dislike Google's Implementation of OAuth2 (see https://developers.google.com/glass/authorization).

I use a generic Python Implementation of OAuth2 which is pretty similar to handling OAuth2 with Facebook & Foursquare APIs.



Updates:

June 24, 2013 - Will clean up code in a few days.
